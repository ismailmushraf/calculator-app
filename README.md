## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Some of the Things I've Learned from working on this Project, see below:

#### Semantic HTML
```html
<header>Header consist of themeToggler and Heading</header>
<main>Main consist of Keypad</main>
```
Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. 

#### CSS Transition
```css
#themeToggler {
  transition: margin-left .5s;
}
```
- Here, the first parameter `margin-left` is the property we need to add an animation to.
- Second parameter `.5s` is the duration of the animation

#### Grid Display
```css
.keypad {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}
```
- `fr` stands for "fraction of available space". It divides the space into equal number of parts.
- `1fr` takes 25% of this space. Because there are 4 cols in a row. `100% / 4 = 25%`.

#### Centering Items vertically and horizontally
```css
.num-key {
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```
This helped me to center the keypad numbers vertically and horizontally centered in the div.


```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
